## Learn CSS Variales

In this lesson, I have learned how to
1. use css varibales
2. use linear-gradient and radial-gradient
3. efficiently use flex-box properties for making the windows for the building of different shape
4. Use media query to make the page responsive.
5. efficiently use border properties to make different shapes of building.

#  Here, if window size is less than equal 1000px, we will see night skyline, otherwise day skyline.
